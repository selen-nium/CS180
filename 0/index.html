            <h1>Project 0 - Becoming Friends with Your Camera</h1>
            <p>(2 Sep 2025) This project aims to gain a basic understanding of certain photography concepts like focal length/zoom, and see how the same object can turn out in different perspectives.</p>

            <h2>Part 1 - Selfie: The Wrong Way vs. The Right Way</h2>
            <p class="description">
                Take a picture of yourself from close up. You get a typical distorted selfie image. Now step back several feet and zoom in. Try to get the faces to be the same size in all the photos.
            </p>

                    <img src="./media/part1/6.jpeg" alt="close up shot"/>
                    <p>^ looks distorted..</p>
                </div>
                <div class="c">
                    <img src="./media/part1/5.jpeg" alt="zoomed in shot"/>

                    <p>^ looks much more proportionate!</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The close up photo exaggerates certain facial features that are nearer to the lens (nose, eyes, etc) and minimises those that are further away (like our ears), making the face look distorted and unnatural. When we step back and zoom in, the difference in distance between the various facial features and the lens decreases, and the face will look more proportionate.</p>

            <h2>Part 2 - Architectural Perspective Compression</h2>
            <p class="description">
                For an urban scene, pick a nice view down a long street (or a walking path on campus), zoom in, and take a photo. Then, walk down the street in the direction of the first shot, and take a second photo without zoom, such that the scene in the two photos appears approximately the same size.
            </p>
            <div class="imageSection part2">
                <div class="row">
                    <img src="./media/part2/far.jpeg" alt="zoomed in shot"/>
                    <img src="./media/part2/near.jpeg" alt="zoomed in shot"/>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The zoomed in photo (left) is more flattened. All the objects (pillars, ceiling, people) look like they are squashed together, whereas the photo without zoom(right) appears to depict the real distances between objects better. This could be because when we stand somewhere far and zoom in, we view everything from the same angle and we can't distinguish the real distances between things. When we go closer, the objects near us appears a lot bigger, and our brain can process the actual distances between objects better.</p>

            <p class="description">
                In this part, we will be duplicating a classic film effect called the dolly zoom. It is a camera movement also known as the "Vertigo shot", after a famous scene in Hitchcock's Vertigo.
